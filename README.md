## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. By implementing a chatbot, we aim to demonstrate how LSTMs can be applied to natural language processing tasks, enabling machines to engage in conversations similar to human interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Ensure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `LSTM_Chatbot_from_scratch.ipynb` file to start exploring the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the `LSTM_Chatbot_from_scratch.ipynb` notebook. The notebook is structured into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: Downloading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Model Building**: Constructing the LSTM model architecture.
3. **Training**: Training the model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance and making predictions.

Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to replicate the project.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python packages, including:

- os
- sys
- tempfile
- urllib.request
- urllib.parse
- urllib.error
- zipfile
- tarfile
- shutil

Additionally, you'll need machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the LSTM model.
